# email_classifier
email classifier implemented from scratch using only the default python libraries, it classifies email texts as either HAM(a real email) or SPAM, using naive bayes.

if you want to try the program, first unzip the two folders that contain the training set and the test set, be sure to put the folders in the same directory as the python file.
